//! A rewrite pass to add typedefs
/*! Because many compilers do not yet support C++11,
  we have to add a unique typename for every identifier in the program.
  For example, the following declaration:
  \verbatim int _a; \endverbatim
  becomes
  \verbatim typedef int T_a;
T_a _a; \endverbatim

  This allows us to use the type of \p _a elsewhere in the program without
  having to know exactly what it was instantiated as.
