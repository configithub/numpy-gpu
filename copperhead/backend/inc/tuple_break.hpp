//! A rewrite pass which makes tuple assembly/disassembly explicit
/*! The input is assumed to have tuples in the form
  \code
  t = x, y
  x, y = t
  \endcode
  Although convenient for the programmer, C++ requires more work to
  deal with tuples.
  \code
  t = x, y
  \endcode
  becomes:
  \code
  t = thrust::make_tuple(x, y)
  \endcode
  Also,
  \code
  x, y = t
  \endcode
  becomes
  \code
  x = thrust::get<0>(t)
  y = thrust::get<1>(t)
  \endcode
  And
  \code
  x, y = z, w
  \endcode
  becomes
  \code
  x = z
  y = w
  \endcode
  
  
  Also, tuples which appear as arguments to a
  function are given a unique id and lowered:
  \code
  def _foo((_a, _b)):
      return _a
  \endcode
  becomes:
  \code
  def _foo(t):
      _a = thrust::get<0>(t)
      _b = thrust::get<1>(t)
      return _a
  \endcode
