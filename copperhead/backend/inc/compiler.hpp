/*! Assembles multiple \ref rewriters to form a compiler for
  the Python Copperhead project.

  This compiler accepts input only in a normalized form:

  - Input is a \ref backend::suite "suite" of \ref backend::procedure
  "procedure" nodes.

  - One of the procedures in the input suite is designated as the
   entry point.

   - The input suite includes the entire program: the
   transitive closure of all procedures called from the entry point,
   excepting procedures supplied by the compiler itself, which are
   tracked by a \ref backend::registry "registry" maintained by the
   compiler.

   - All expressions in the input suite are flattened.  For
   example, \verbatim a = b + c * d \endverbatim must have been
   flattened to \verbatim e0 = c * d
a = b + e0 \endverbatim

   - All closures are made explicit with \ref backend::closure
   "closure" objects.

   - All \ref backend::lambda "lambda" functions are lifted to
   procedures.

   - All nested procedures have been flattened.

   - The \p suite has been typechecked, and AST nodes in the \p suite
   are populated with type information.
